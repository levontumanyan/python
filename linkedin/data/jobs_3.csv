The Databases team owns the telemetry databases that are Mimir for metrics, Loki for logs, Tempo for traces, and Pyroscope for profiles. Our databases are OSS projects that we also offer as a Cloud service supporting Grafana Cloud, and as an on-premise solution. They are multi-tenant distributed systems implemented in Go and running on Kubernetes across all major Cloud service providers (GCP, Azure, AWS). We also have engineers working on Prometheus, Grafana Agent, Mimir proxies, and OpenTelemetry.
  

  

As a company we are remote-first and global, we embrace people of different experiences and backgrounds to build diverse teams where every person brings a new perspective to the software. Our tech stack is mostly made up of services written in Go, running on multiple Kubernetes clusters that leverage Cloud object storage.

* Learn new skills by gaining a deeper understanding of our cloud product and our customers and getting to know the codebase of a large distributed system

As we are remote-first and our engineering organization is largely remote, we provide guidance and meet regularly using video calls, so an independent attitude and good communication skills are a must.

* You are customer focused. We build everything with our users in mind. You have a passion for creating intuitive products that fit customers’ needs
* Pragmatism: You are able to take on complex challenges and break them down to achieve short feedback loops: to analyze, design, and build modular solutions, deliver MVPs, gather data and feedback and then progress iteratively
* Collaboration and communication: The smallest unit we have is a team. You’ll be working with your teammates in a fully remote setup. Good communication skills are a must

**Requirements**

* Solid experience with at least one programming language. We use Go, but if you have familiarity with Python, C, C++, Rust or similar then that translates well
* Some experience with delivering projects from gathering requirements, brainstorming ideas all the way to shipping a product to the customer’s hands in a self-driven way
* Some experience with developing software that runs in the Cloud or some experience with systems engineering
* Experience writing clean, robust, and performant software that is easily maintained by others

**Nice To Haves**

* Experience working with Kubernetes
